print( 2 > 1)
print("Lij" == "Lij") # Double equal signs mean its comparing if the values are "THE SAME"

# Logical Operator Family
# it checks and compares if certain code conditions are true or false

print(5>1 and "Lij" == "Lij") # The AND operator checks to see if ONE condition is true
# If true then it will return true
# OR means so long as 1 of the conditions is true it will return TRUE
